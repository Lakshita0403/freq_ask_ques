        <i class=" icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
      </div>

      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          The purpose of Bhagavad-gita is to deliver humankind from the
          ignorance of material existence.Every one of us is full of anxieties
          because of this material existence. In the material world we are
          caught in the repeated cycle of birth and death.

        <h4>Who is the proper student of the Gita?</h4>
        <i class=" icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
      </div>

      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          Those who begin to question why they are suffering or where they came
          from and where they shall go after death are proper students for
          understanding Bhagavad-gita. The sincere student should also have a
          firm respect for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such a student
          was Arjuna.

              As stated in Bhagavad Gita 9.27,<br>
           yat karoṣi yad aśnāsi <br> yaj juhoṣi
          dadāsi <br>yat yat tapasyasi <br>kaunteya tat kuruṣva mad-arpaṇam <br><br>
          Translation: <br>
          Whatever you do, whatever you eat, whatever you offer or give away,
          and whatever austerities you perform – do that, O son of Kuntī, as an
          offering to Me. We should eat things only after offered it to Krishna,
          we should give some amount of our earnings in service to Krishna. We
          should adjust our daily life activities in such a way that we get time
          for chanting Krishna’s name, remembering Him and giving the message of
          Bhagavad Gita to others.

        <h4>Why do devotees also suffer from diseases?</h4>
        <i class=" icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
      </div>

      <div class="answer">
        <p>Because we all have material bodies which are subjected to material 
            laws and hence getting diseased is natural. But even in a diseased 
            condition, a devotee is able to remember Krishna and doesn’t get
             disturbed by disease.</p>

        <h4>
            How Bhagavad Gita makes us peaceful?
        </h4>
        <i class=" icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
      </div>

      <div class="answer">
        <p>
            When we see things from our perspective, we cannot know what 
            is good for us in long run. But when we know what Krishna wants
             then we will be peaceful because Krishna cares for our ultimate 
             benefit in a bigger perspective.

      <div class="answer">
        <p>The word Srimad is a title of great respect. This is given because the

        <i class=" icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>

    <div class="answer">
        <p>Narayana is the supreme deity who helps the people to cross the ocean
            of bondages. Narayana according to the followers of Vaishnavism is
            the ultimate truth and reality, the beginning of the world and also
            its end. Hence, Lord Krishna is none other than Narayana for his 
            Bhaktas (devotees).</p>
